# flam-parametric-assignment
Research &amp; Development assignment – Determination of unknown parameters (θ, M, X) in a parametric model using L1 optimization.
This term adds a sinusoidal “wobble” perpendicular to the base line.  
Together, the curve can be visualized as a **wavy line tilted at angle θ**, with its amplitude slightly increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of M.
